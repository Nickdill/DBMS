####Relational Database Management System

This is a project I am currently working on. To prevent other students from
copying my code, I will be waiting until October 24th to post this here.

Cheers!

This is an early version of Brackets, a code editor for HTML, CSS
and JavaScript that's *built* in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

What makes Brackets different from other web code editors?

* **Tools shouldn't get in your way.** Instead of cluttering up your coding
environment with lots of panels and icons, the Quick Edit UI in Brackets puts 
context-specific code and tools inline.
* **Brackets is in sync with your browser.** With Live Preview, Brackets
works directly with your browser to push code edits instantly and jump
back and forth between your real source code and the browser view.
* **Do it yourself.** Because Brackets is open source, and built with HTML, CSS
and JavaScript, you can [help build](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) the best code editor for the web.

You can see some 
[screenshots of Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Screenshots)
on the wiki, [intro videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/CodeBrackets) on YouTube, and news on the [Brackets blog](http://blog.brackets.io/).
